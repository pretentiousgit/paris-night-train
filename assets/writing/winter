the climate is burning us down
at home our faith is the cold

unity in extremity

so come on king winter
it's colder in Calgary than the surface of Mars

spared ticks and mosquitos by flu and slow ice
the cracks spreading over the lake
the fish asleep in the bottom

while nature hugs us to death
we can pretend everything's normal
a century cold, the end of the world
a history of freezing to death
