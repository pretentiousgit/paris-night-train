## This is a game about quiet endings.

Somewhere, someone is boarding a train on a late summer evening when the world was soft. The clouds are on the horizon. The train will soon be cancelled. Like many youngs, this young doesn't know who to be.

They wake in the night, their travel companion soundly asleep, and seek out the human basics: 

a snack.

The bathroom.

Some company, maybe - they're hoping the night train will help them figure it out, but they run the risk of waking from their own dreams and arriving back where they started, in a Toronto suburb, not sure if there's a bigger world out there after all.

### Mechanics:
This is an early build designed to sample how you can procedurally generate levels in [Phaser-CE](http://phaser.io/). It represents a bunch of work updating and patching and reverting [Phaser-ES6-Webpack](https://github.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack), and a bunch of work in various examples and tutorials for how to do a top-town tilemap driven game.
