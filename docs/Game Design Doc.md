## Overview
Paris Night Train is a generative action-RPG about a character trying to find themselves by travelling on a cancelled train between Berlin and Paris. They explore the train at night, seeking snacks, a bathroom, a drink of water… and secretly looking for the meaningful travel experience that will reveal to them who they are. 

## Theme / Setting / Genre
Paris Night Train is set in a magical-realist world inside a train. The time period is contemporary, but because it's night, there aren't cell phones as such - more like selfie devices. On their journey, a player will run into men with the heads of stags, women on a hen party, characters from all backgrounds doing the thing that makes them happiest.

But what do _you_ want from life? You don't know! So you keep looking, because to start with, you're thirsty and hungry and need to use the bathroom. This pushes you out of bed and down the train, half-asleep, dreaming of your awful suburban hometown and hoping to have a better life. 

Maybe you dream of being more artistic - a life as a glamourous photographer, or of being super buff and confident in tomorrow as a stag. Perhaps you long for the glamourous escape of a pink nightclub - or maybe escape isn't your jam, and you'd like to be a banker. The game assembles experiences, but without talking to other players, how can you reveal what it is you dislike and what you prefer?

The risk is real though - this sleepwalking episode can see you wake, and if you wake, what will you wake to? A paris garret? A good job?

Or your childhood bedroom in Mississagua, listening to your parents wake up and thinking about whether you'll ever escape the winter?

This quest is in deadly serious - you have one last night to find your motivation.

Better get looking.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics Brief

- Paris Night Train takes place on A Train.
- the train is procedurally generated and guaranteed to have 
  - A Bathroom
  - A Snacks Trolley (somewhere)
  - A Dining Car
  - Your Bedroom Car
  - An Observation Car (contains businessmen)

- Optional cars include
  - The Forest Car
  - The Chicken Coop
  - The Photographer Party
  - The Businessman's Fascist Future Car (Acela)
  - A Library Cart
  - Some Drunk Australians 
  - The Murder On The Orient Express


### Etc Mechanics
- Each train car contains between 3 and 5 carriages
- Each carriage is themed up between different types of worlds
- The character is trying to get out and then back to bed with a full health bar…?
- A health bar is represented by ten faces, from confidence down to sadness/depression.
- A healthy face is fully coloured, a sad face is more gray
- You start from neutral and then can get “sunnier” or “less happy”
- Each carriage is a puzzle that lets the character work out where a “key” to the next section is
- Characters find keys by talking to other wakeful people on the train
- The Dining Car or Snack Trolley has snacks
  - the Snack Trolley moves and appears at random
  - the Snack Trolley will require a Snack Trolley operator
- The bathroom is in the third car?
- You can gather A Snack, A Drink, and A Pee before heading back to bed
- Each round, you have to risk talking to characters in cars
- Talking to a character triggers an “emotional response” - an interaction with XXXXXX that represents an improvement or an increased sadness.
- The Pee, Snacks, and Drink are represented by icons
- They can happen in any order, but once they’ve happened, the train car starts to go to “sleep” and it’s harder to find what you’re doing? There’s a Sleep Timer for you to go to bed?
- A game consists of:
- Intro Screen
- Victory Screen
- Loss Screen #1 - Mississagua
- Loss Screen #2 - A Field Of Flowers You’ve Been Kicked Into
- A “struggle” with the conductors for getting too rowdy

#### The Elevator Pitch
Paris Night Train features a character travelling with a friend on the night train between Berlin and Paris. They wake in the night somewhere between the two cities, and get up to look for the bathroom - but also a bigger dream. Help them find the washroom, maybe some snacks, and guide them back to bed through a magical-realist landscape on a cancelled train.

Your choices and interactions decide whether your character gets to wake up on an adventure, or whether it was all a dream. 

Or your childhood bedroom in Mississagua, listening to your parents wake up and thinking about whether you'll ever escape the winter?

This quest is in deadly serious - you have one last night to find your motivation.

Better get looking.

Project Description (Detailed)

<Four Paragraphs or more If needs be>
<No more than six paragraphs>

What sets this project apart?
	- Procedural generation is hot, but it tends to be disconnected from feeling
	- A narrative about a grown-up experience lets the audience escape from the 18-35 demographic
	- There is still only one Gone Home and one Monument Valley, because it's hard to take feeling seriously.
